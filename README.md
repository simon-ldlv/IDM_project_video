REPOSITORY FOR THE PROJECT IDM : VideoGen Library 

To concatenate and process our videos, we used FFMPEG, an online video / audio
processing control software. The API has several features:
-Generate the longest video from an input model.
- Generate a video (choice of alternative and optional random videos) from an input model
- Generate a gif from an input video
- Generate thumbnails from a directory containing .mp4 videos
- Generate a CSV file describing all possible combinations of videos.
Our API has been imported into our Jhipster project as an archive named VideoGen.jar.
Our main API class is named VideoGenStation.java
